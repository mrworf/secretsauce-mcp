SecretSauce is a self-hosted MCP service that lets Codex, ChatGPT-compatible MCP clients, and other supported agents call configured HTTP services while keeping raw configured credentials out of the normal request flow. Credential substitution and response protection happen in the gateway backend; they do not depend on the agent recognizing secrets or keeping them confidential. Response protection is defense in depth, not a guarantee against arbitrary computation performed by an admin-approved downstream endpoint.

The service acts as an MCP-controlled credential gateway. Agents get short-lived gateway service references, then use those references in approved service requests. The gateway enforces authentication, destination validation, reference binding, and policy before substituting protected backend values and making the downstream HTTP call. It also scans downstream responses and replaces detected secrets with opaque references before returning the response to the agent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Recommended client:** This MCP works with ChatGPT in Chat mode, but Codex or ChatGPT Work mode is recommended for operational and multi-step service workflows. Chat mode may apply platform-level action safety checks that block an otherwise valid action before the tool call reaches this server; in that case, the gateway cannot provide a request ID or explain the denial. Codex and Work mode use agent-oriented security models built around sandboxing, approvals, and tool-specific controls, which are a better fit for these workflows. They are not less secure; they enforce security through a different execution and approval model. See [OpenAI's agent approvals and security documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security).
>
> The client mode does not weaken this gateway's controls. Authentication, destination validation, policy enforcement, reference binding, protected-value substitution, and auditing remain enforced by the server for every client.

## What It Provides

<img align="right" src="assets/brand/secretsauce-chef.png" alt="SecretSauce chef holding a protected secret recipe" width="150" style="padding: 10px">

- Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint for configured clients.
- A small generic tool surface for listing services, getting gateway service references, making service requests, and explaining denials.
- Server-side credential substitution after auth, destination validation, and policy checks.
- Agent-facing credential reference templates with optional, default-off ownership enforcement for configured authentication headers.
- Default-deny request policy with explainable denials.
- Secretlint response scanning plus configurable sensitive-name detection that replaces detected values with reversible, service-scoped `sec_…` tokens.
- Structured audit logging designed to avoid raw credentials, opaque reference values, authorization headers, cookies, and downstream response bodies.
- Docker deployment with a non-root runtime user and healthcheck.

## Safety Model

In the normal supported flow, agents receive opaque references instead of raw API keys, passwords, bearer tokens, cookies, or other configured downstream credentials. Those values remain on the backend while the gateway performs authentication, destination validation, token validation, policy approval, and substitution. These controls do not rely on model instructions, prompt compliance, agent memory, or agent-side redaction.

> [!WARNING]
> **Approved endpoints are part of the credential security boundary.** Response scanning can replace exact configured credentials and recognized secret patterns, but it cannot recognize every reversible transformation. If an allowed downstream endpoint can echo, encode, template, execute, inspect, or otherwise transform caller-controlled input containing an opaque reference, it may return a representation that the caller can reverse into the raw credential. Administrators should allow only the methods and routes the agent needs, prefer narrowly structured non-computational APIs, and avoid generic debug, echo, script, command, template, and proxy endpoints unless this residual risk is explicitly accepted.

The gateway uses two kinds of opaque placeholders:

- `gref_…` references represent configured service access. They are bound to the authenticated subject, originating service, destination, and access entry.
- `sec_…` references represent secrets detected while scanning downstream responses. Detection and replacement happen on the backend before the response reaches the agent, and these references are bound to the authenticated subject and originating service.

Both reference types work only when submitted back through this gateway and expire under configured idle and maximum TTLs. The MCP HTTP transport is stateless: every POST is authenticated independently, and reference continuity comes from authenticated-subject binding rather than an MCP session.

The proxied HTTP surface is deliberately cookie-free: caller-supplied cookie headers are rejected and downstream cookie headers are discarded. APIs that require browser-style cookie sessions are not supported. Response JSON is scanned as source text without deserialization or reserialization. A tolerant lexical scanner uses configurable, case-insensitive name patterns to protect complete string values in direct fields and common environment shapes, including recoverable JSON with comments, duplicate keys, missing commas, or a truncated outer container. A whole response body is decoded and scanned as Base64 only when it declares `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64`. A string request body with the same declaration is decoded, has opaque references substituted with JSON-safe source edits when applicable, and is canonically re-encoded before delivery; undeclared Base64-looking content and application-specific transformations remain opaque.

Downstream response bodies remain byte-oriented. Likely text is fully scanned even when labeled `application/octet-stream`; clean likely-binary responses up to 100 KiB are returned losslessly as MCP embedded blobs, while protected-data findings and larger binary bodies fail closed by default.

For every downstream request, the gateway validates the authenticated client, requested service, destination, URL, method, reference binding, and configured policy before replacing opaque references with real credentials. If a request is denied, the client can ask for an explanation instead of guessing around policy boundaries.

## Supported Deployment Topology

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run exactly one SecretSauce gateway instance for each configuration and public MCP endpoint. Stateless MCP HTTP means every POST is authenticated independently; it does not make gateway application state stateless.

Gateway references, response-secret references, denial records, and other runtime capability state are instance-local and intentionally ephemeral. A load balancer distributing requests across replicas can send a follow-up request to an instance that does not own its reference, causing apparently random reference failures. Sticky sessions are not a supported substitute: MCP has no transport session to pin, rebalancing and restarts still lose affinity, and capability limits require atomic shared state. Horizontal replicas require a shared atomic capability store, which this release does not provide.

For the supported single instance, mount writable persistent storage for audit JSONL and, when configured, the built-in OAuth hash-only refresh-state file. The refresh-state file has a single-process writer contract. Mount the built-in OAuth signing key from stable read-only storage so access tokens survive restarts. Do not mount or attempt to persist `gref_` or `sec_` runtime state; those references expire on restart by design.

## Container Image

Images are published to GitHub Container Registry:

```text
ghcr.io/mrworf/secretsauce-mcp
```

Package page: [github.com/mrworf/secretsauce-mcp/pkgs/container/secretsauce-mcp](https://github.com/mrworf/secretsauce-mcp/pkgs/container/secretsauce-mcp)

The CI workflow runs `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` first. The Docker image job depends on those quality gates, so a failing build or test run prevents image publishing. Pull requests validate the Docker build without pushing an image; pushes to `main` publish the GHCR image.

## Merge Protection

The workflow reports the `quality-gates` check on pull requests. To make failed checks block merges into `main`, configure a GitHub branch protection rule or ruleset that requires `quality-gates` before merging.

## Production HTTPS with HAProxy

Remote production deployments must expose SecretSauce through HTTPS. Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy such as HAProxy in front of the gateway, keep the gateway's HTTP listener private, and do not publish the backend port directly to untrusted networks. Equivalent TLS reverse proxies are supported; HAProxy is shown here as a compact same-host example:

```haproxy
frontend secretsauce_https
  bind :443 ssl crt /etc/haproxy/certs/mcp.example.org.pem
  mode http
  default_backend secretsauce_backend

backend secretsauce_backend
  mode http
  option httpchk GET /health
  http-check expect status 200
  server secretsauce 127.0.0.1:8080 check
```

The loopback HTTP hop above is acceptable because HAProxy and SecretSauce share a host and the backend listener is not remotely reachable. If the reverse proxy and gateway run on different hosts, protect that hop with TLS or an isolated, authenticated network. Firewall the gateway so only the reverse proxy can reach it.

Configure public OAuth values explicitly with HTTPS. The gateway does not use `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-Proto` to infer its public origin:

```yaml
server:
  listen: 127.0.0.1:8080
  mcp_path: /mcp
  resource: https://mcp.example.org

auth:
  mode: oauth
  oauth:
    issuer: https://auth.example.org
    audience: https://mcp.example.org
    jwks_uri: https://auth.example.org/.well-known/jwks.json
    required_scopes:
      - gateway.read
      - gateway.references
      - gateway.request
```

For built-in OAuth, set `auth.builtin_oauth.issuer` to the same public HTTPS
origin as `server.resource`. The origin values do not include the MCP path;
ChatGPT and Codex use the full MCP Server URL `https://mcp.example.org/mcp`.
Activated v2 deployments can select
`auth.builtin_oauth.identity_source: database` for ordinary-user
password-plus-TOTP and linked-OIDC authorization with durable hash-only opaque
tokens. This mode requires a stable mode-`0400` `token_hmac_key_file` and
prohibits the static administrator, signing key, and refresh-state file. See
[the configuration reference](docs/config-reference.md#auth).

SecretSauce rejects non-loopback HTTP resource, issuer, and JWKS URLs by default. Exact loopback HTTP URLs remain supported for local development. A trusted development network can explicitly accept cleartext OAuth trust with `server.allow_insecure_oauth_http: true`; this emits one sanitized startup warning. Missing `server.resource` in OAuth mode also remains a startup warning.

## Local Docker Example

```yaml
services:
  secretsauce-vault:
    image: ghcr.io/example-org/secretsauce-mcp:latest
    command: ["node", "dist/vault/main.js"]
    volumes:
      - ./vault.yaml:/config/vault.yaml:ro
      - ./vault-keys:/run/vault-keys:ro
      - ./vault-runtime:/run/secretsauce-vault
      - ./vault-store:/var/lib/secretsauce/vault
    environment:
      SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_CONFIG: /config/vault.yaml
      SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET: /run/secretsauce-vault/vault.sock
      SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_DATA_KEY_FILE: /run/vault-keys/data-plane.key
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "node", "dist/vault/healthCli.js"]

  secretsauce:
    image: ghcr.io/example-org/secretsauce-mcp:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro
      - ./secretlint.yaml:/config/secretlint.yaml:ro
      - ./sensitive-names.yaml:/config/sensitive-names.yaml:ro
      - ./secrets:/run/secrets:ro
      - ./oauth:/run/oauth:ro
      - ./audit:/var/lib/secretsauce/audit
      - ./oauth-state:/var/lib/secretsauce/oauth
      - ./vault-keys/data-plane.key:/run/vault-caller/data-plane.key:ro
      - ./vault-keys/resolve-capability.key:/run/vault-caller/resolve-capability.key:ro
      - ./vault-runtime:/run/secretsauce-vault:ro
    environment:
      CONFIG_PATH: /config/config.yaml
      SECRETLINT_CONFIG_PATH: /config/secretlint.yaml
      SENSITIVE_NAMES_CONFIG_PATH: /config/sensitive-names.yaml
      SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET: /run/secretsauce-vault/vault.sock
      SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_DATA_KEY_FILE: /run/vault-caller/data-plane.key
      SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_RESOLVE_KEY_FILE: /run/vault-caller/resolve-capability.key
```

Use the writable audit mount for `audit.file`, for example `/var/lib/secretsauce/audit/audit.jsonl`. Monitor `/health` and disk capacity: an audit open or write failure keeps privileged operations fail-open but changes readiness to `503` with a sanitized audit-degraded check until restart. The open descriptor supports `copytruncate`-style rotation; rename-based rotation requires a restart. Static built-in OAuth keeps `signing_key_file` on stable read-only storage and can use a writable `refresh_token_store_file` for hash-only refresh continuity. Database built-in OAuth instead keeps `token_hmac_key_file` on stable mode-`0400` storage; its hash-only token and grant state is already in the durable SQLite database.

The vault broker is a separate process with no TCP listener. Start from
[`examples/vault.yaml`](examples/vault.yaml), create each listed key with
`npm run vault:key -- generate --output /absolute/path/to/key`, and set every key
file to mode `0400`. The socket directory and encrypted store use modes `0750`
(or stricter) and `0700`; make their container ownership explicit before startup.
The broker mounts all caller/verifier and root keys, while each caller mounts only
its own caller key and the socket directory. Root keys and the encrypted store
must never be mounted into a caller container. Keep the root-key mount stable
across restart; the passphrase-encrypted backup flow is the recovery path when a
root key is unavailable.

`node dist/vault/healthCli.js` performs an authenticated, sanitized readiness
check and prints only `ready` or `unavailable`. The optional control-process
variables `SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET` and
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_CONTROL_KEY_FILE` add the same safe `checks.vault` seam to
`/api/v2/health`. Write-only credential management and authorized data-plane
resolution are connected through the isolated broker. To make published v2
configuration the sole MCP authority, follow
[Persisted runtime authorization](docs/runtime-authorization.md).

### Initial v2 identity bootstrap

When `persistence.database_file` is configured, build the application and run the
bootstrap command directly on the gateway host:

```bash
CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/config.yaml npm run identity:bootstrap
```

For a container deployment, run the same command with an interactive terminal in
the gateway container, for example `docker compose exec secretsauce npm run
identity:bootstrap`. Do not append an email, password, TOTP value, or other
profile field as a command argument. The command refuses non-terminal execution
and prompts for the email and optional names.

Bootstrap succeeds only when the database contains no users and has no prior
bootstrap marker. It atomically creates one UUID-backed local `superadmin` in
`enrollment_required` state with a hash-only, expiring temporary password and a
sanitized bootstrap audit event. Its output contains the UUID, role, state,
expiry, and temporary password exactly once. Save that value directly in a
password manager; it is not retrievable later. A second or racing attempt cannot
create another initial superadmin.

The temporary password is not MCP-eligible and cannot create an ordinary browser
session. It enters only the restricted enrollment ceremony, where the user
chooses a permanent password and confirms TOTP before activation.

For host-local recovery of any existing account, run
`CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/config.yaml npm run identity:break-glass` from an
interactive terminal. It accepts no arguments, asks for a UUID or email and an
exact confirmation, preserves UUID/role, revokes sessions, erases existing
password/TOTP material, and displays a new temporary password once. Never paste
the temporary value into command arguments, logs, tickets, or chat.

Expose the service through an HTTPS endpoint such as `https://gateway.example.org/mcp` when using remote MCP clients.
