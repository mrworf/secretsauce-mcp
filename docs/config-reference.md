# SecretSauce Configuration Reference

The gateway uses a primary YAML file, a Secretlint rules YAML, and a sensitive-name rules YAML, all mounted read-only in Docker. Secrets are not stored in these files; use environment variables or mounted files.

## Supported Deployment Topology

The supported replica count is exactly one gateway instance per configuration and public MCP endpoint. MCP HTTP is stateless at the transport layer, but gateway references, response-secret references, denial records, limiters, and other capability state are held by the owning process. Horizontal load balancing can route a follow-up call to a replica that does not own its reference and cause intermittent `reference_invalid` failures.

Sticky sessions do not provide the missing shared atomic capability store: there is no MCP transport session to pin, affinity can be lost during restart or rebalance, and per-subject/service capacities must be coordinated atomically. Do not deploy multiple replicas until a shared capability store is implemented.

The single instance should mount stable read-only built-in OAuth signing keys plus writable persistent audit storage. If built-in OAuth refresh continuity is enabled, mount its hash-only refresh-state path on writable persistent storage and allow only this one process to write it. Opaque `gref_` and `sec_` state remains intentionally ephemeral and must not be placed on a shared filesystem.

## Vault broker

The vault broker uses its own closed YAML document; see
[`examples/vault.yaml`](../examples/vault.yaml). It runs as a separate process,
listens only on a Unix-domain socket, and owns the encrypted record store and
root keys. Key files contain one canonical 32-byte base64url key, have mode
`0400`, and are generated with
`npm run vault:key -- generate --output /absolute/path/to/key`; the command never
prints key bytes or replaces an existing file.

The broker requires distinct data, control, backup, resolve-capability, and
backup-capability keys. The broker mounts all of them. A caller mounts only its
own caller key and the socket directory—never root keys, the encrypted store, or
another caller's key. Socket mode is `0600` by default or explicitly `0660` for
a shared deployment group. The store directory is `0700`, records are `0600`,
and key/socket/store paths reject links, unsafe ownership, or writable modes.

Start the broker with `SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_CONFIG=/config/vault.yaml
node dist/vault/main.js`. The authenticated health command uses
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET` plus `SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_DATA_KEY_FILE` and returns
only `ready` or `unavailable`. A separately started control process can use
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET` plus
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_CONTROL_KEY_FILE`; `/api/v2/health` then includes only
`checks.vault: ready|unavailable`. Supplying just one variable fails startup
without echoing either path.

Portable encrypted-backup coordination uses `SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET`,
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_BACKUP_KEY_FILE`, and
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_BACKUP_CAPABILITY_KEY_FILE` as one complete set. The caller
mounts only those two backup keys and the socket; neither key permits ordinary
credential writes or runtime resolution. Omitting the set leaves
credential-less backup available. Supplying a partial set fails startup, and an
unavailable broker produces only a generic encrypted-backup failure. See
[Portable Backup Export](backup-export.md).

Vault archives use Argon2id with 64 MiB memory, three iterations, and parallelism
one, then independently authenticated 64 KiB AES-256-GCM chunks and a final
manifest. Imports reject parameter changes, excess sizes/counts, reordering,
truncation, and tampering before atomically replacing the active encrypted
record set. Wrong passphrases and authenticated-content tampering share one
stable failure. Archive passphrases are never command arguments or persisted
temporary files.

## Persistence and initial identity bootstrap

Set `persistence.database_file` to the durable SQLite path owned by the single
gateway instance:

```yaml
persistence:
  database_file: /var/lib/secretsauce/control.sqlite
```

The parent directory must be writable by the gateway process. The database file
is created with mode `0600`, migrations complete before listeners start, and a
second application writer is rejected.

### Persisted MCP runtime authority

Set `runtime.authority: database`, keep `services: {}`, and configure
`persistence.database_file` to make activated v2 snapshots the sole MCP
authority. Database authority rejects YAML services; YAML authority still
requires at least one YAML service. See
[Persisted runtime authorization](runtime-authorization.md) for activation,
vault mounts, invalidation, reference, readiness, and rollback constraints.

The database runtime requires `SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_SOCKET`,
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_DATA_KEY_FILE`, and
`SECRETSAUCE_VAULT_RESOLVE_KEY_FILE`. Supplying an incomplete or invalid runtime
vault setup stops startup. The gateway caller mounts only the data-plane and
resolve-capability keys.

After at least one service is published, stop the database-owning gateway and
run `CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/config.yaml npm run runtime:activate-v2` from
an interactive terminal. The command accepts no arguments and continues only
after the exact input `ACTIVATE V2`. Activation is atomic, audited, and one-way;
database mode never falls back to YAML. In this mode `/health` reports stable
`database`, `schema`, `runtime_activation`, and `vault` checks and returns `503`
when any required check is unavailable.

On a fresh database, run `CONFIG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/config.yaml npm run
identity:bootstrap` from an interactive terminal on the gateway host. In Docker,
use an interactive exec such as `docker compose exec secretsauce npm run
identity:bootstrap`. The command accepts no arguments: email and optional names
are terminal prompts, and password/TOTP material is never accepted from the
operator.

The one-time transaction creates a UUIDv7 `superadmin` with status
`enrollment_required`, a hash-only temporary password, `not_configured` TOTP
state, a singleton bootstrap marker, and a sanitized `identity.bootstrap` audit
event. Output displays the generated temporary password exactly once. It can
enter only the restricted enrollment flow and cannot authenticate an ordinary
control or MCP request.

## Local browser authentication

The optional `identity` block enables password-plus-TOTP authentication on the
control listener. It requires both `control` and `persistence`. See
[Local browser authentication](local-authentication.md) for the complete
configuration, key-mount, session, step-up, and operational security contract.

The optional `identity.oidc` block adds standards-compliant external browser
authentication without changing MCP authentication. Provider issuer, client,
callback, assurance, claim-ownership, network, cache, and flow settings are
documented in [Generic OIDC identity provider](oidc-identity-provider.md).
`redirect_origin` must exactly equal `control.public_origin`; provider subjects
are linked explicitly and matching email never authenticates or links a user.

When persistence, control, and identity are enabled, durable service
administration is available at `/control/services`. See
[Service management](service-management.md) for ownership, destination,
publication, transfer, archive, deletion, and runtime-isolation semantics.
Database-managed service records affect MCP routing only after explicit v2
activation and only when `runtime.authority: database`.

Service-scoped group and assignment management is available at
`/control/groups`. See [Groups and service assignments](group-assignments.md)
for selector, membership, effective-access, invalidation, and account-continuity
semantics. In activated database runtime mode, committed assignment changes are
reconciled before the next authorization read.

`identity.temporary_password_ttl` defaults to `72h` and is bounded from `1h`
through `7d`. `identity.restricted_session_ttl` defaults to `15m` and is bounded
from `5m` through `30m`. Restricted enrollment cookies never authorize ordinary
control or MCP routes.

If an existing account cannot authenticate, run the terminal-only
`identity:break-glass` command on the gateway host. It accepts no arguments,
preserves the selected UUID and role, invalidates active state, erases existing
authenticators, and displays one new expiring temporary password. Target-not-found
and reset failures use the same output and never echo the submitted identifier.

## Startup diagnostics

Invalid gateway, Secretlint, and sensitive-name YAML stops startup with a structured `config_error`. Each actionable diagnostic includes the configuration file, dotted field path when known, 1-based line and column, a detailed reason, a sanitized source excerpt, and a caret. Missing fields point to the nearest existing parent node; unreadable files have no fabricated source position.

Source excerpts preserve indentation, field names, and YAML punctuation, but mask all scalar characters. This makes the failing structure recognizable without writing an accidentally inlined credential or other configuration value to logs.

## Server
- `server.listen`: bind address in `host:port` form, for example `0.0.0.0:8080`.
- `server.mcp_path`: Streamable HTTP MCP path, usually `/mcp`.
- `server.resource`: public resource URL used in OAuth metadata and challenges.
- `server.allow_insecure_oauth_http`: explicit acceptance of non-loopback cleartext OAuth trust URLs; defaults to `false` and should be used only on an explicitly trusted development network.

OAuth trust URLs (`server.resource`, external OAuth issuer and JWKS URL, and the built-in OAuth issuer) must not contain URL userinfo or fragments. Invalid values stop startup with a field-specific diagnostic that does not echo the configured URL.
HTTPS is required for non-loopback OAuth trust URLs by default. Exact `localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, and `::1` HTTP URLs remain available for local development. Setting `server.allow_insecure_oauth_http: true` permits non-loopback HTTP resource, issuer, and JWKS URLs and emits one sanitized startup warning.

## Auth
Production OAuth mode:

```yaml
auth:
  mode: oauth
  oauth:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
    audience: secretsauce
    jwks_uri: https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
    principal_claim: sub
    required_scopes:
      - gateway.read
      - gateway.references
      - gateway.request
```

Development bearer mode:

```yaml
auth:
  mode: bearer
  bearer:
    token_env: SECRETSAUCE_MCP_TOKEN
```

Bearer mode is simpler and useful for local deployments, but OAuth is the production path.

`auth.oauth.principal_claim` defaults to `sub`. The selected claim must be a non-empty string and becomes the subject used by service ACLs and opaque-reference binding. Client-credentials issuers may select a stable claim such as `client_id`; tokens missing the configured claim are rejected and never share a fallback identity.

Built-in OAuth mode for a private ChatGPT-hosted MCP:

```yaml
server:
  resource: https://mcp.example.org

auth:
  mode: builtin_oauth
  builtin_oauth:
    issuer: https://mcp.example.org
    admin_username_env: SECRETSAUCE_ADMIN_USERNAME
    admin_password_hash_env: SECRETSAUCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
    signing_key_file: /run/secrets/oauth_signing_key.pem
    access_token_ttl: 1h
    authorization_code_ttl: 5m
    refresh_token_idle_ttl: 30d
    refresh_token_max_ttl: 90d
    refresh_token_store_file: /var/lib/secretsauce/oauth/refresh-state.json
    allowed_clients:
      - https://chatgpt.com
    required_scopes:
      - gateway.read
      - gateway.references
      - gateway.request
```

`builtin_oauth` defaults to `identity_source: static`, the private
single-admin compatibility mode. It publishes authorization-server discovery
from this gateway, accepts CIMD public clients with PKCE, and issues JWT access
tokens plus rotating opaque refresh tokens for the MCP resource. Store
`SECRETSAUCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` as
`pbkdf2-sha256$iterations$saltBase64url$hashBase64url`, not as a raw password.
The signing key must be stable across restarts.

For activated v2 deployments, `identity_source: database` replaces the static
administrator with eligible ordinary users:

```yaml
auth:
  mode: builtin_oauth
  builtin_oauth:
    identity_source: database
    issuer: https://mcp.example.org
    token_hmac_key_file: /run/oauth/token-hmac.key
    access_token_ttl: 5m
    authorization_code_ttl: 5m
    refresh_token_idle_ttl: 30d
    refresh_token_max_ttl: 90d
    allowed_clients:
      - https://chatgpt.com
      - https://client.example.org
    required_scopes:
      - gateway.read
      - gateway.references
      - gateway.request
```

Database identity requires `persistence`, `identity`, empty YAML `services`,
and `runtime.authority: database`. It prohibits static admin credentials,
signing keys, and `refresh_token_store_file`. `token_hmac_key_file` contains one
canonical 32-byte base64url key, must be an absolute regular file with mode
`0400`, and must remain stable. The database stores only domain-separated keyed
hashes of authorization codes and opaque access/refresh tokens. Refresh
rotation, replay-family revocation, account/security epochs, resource, scopes,
and current service eligibility are checked from durable state.

Local MCP authorization requires an active ordinary user with a permanent
password, configured TOTP, and at least one effective assignment to an
activated published service. Configured OIDC providers can authorize an
explicitly linked ordinary user only after their required MFA assurance.
Admins, superadmins, inactive or incomplete accounts, unlinked assertions, and
users with no effective service share the same public failure. Service,
credential, destination, and policy authority is never frozen into an OAuth
grant; it is re-evaluated for every stateless MCP POST.

Keep `server.resource` and `auth.builtin_oauth.issuer` as the same HTTPS origin,
for example `https://mcp.example.org`. ChatGPT's Server URL and Codex MCP URL
must include the MCP path: `https://mcp.example.org/mcp`.

The consent page verifies the allowlisted HTTPS client metadata document, its exact `client_id`, and the requested redirect URI before displaying credential fields. When verified metadata contains a non-empty `client_name` of at most 120 characters, the page uses it to identify the requesting client; otherwise it displays the neutral name “MCP client.” Technical OAuth values remain available under “Connection details.”

Client metadata retrieval never follows redirects and connects only to a DNS-resolved, pinned public address while retaining HTTPS hostname verification. Loopback, private, link-local, multicast, unspecified, documentation, and other special-use IPv4/IPv6 ranges are rejected. Responses must be JSON, are limited to 5 KiB and five seconds, and are cached only when HTTP freshness permits (at most one hour) in a 1,000-entry LRU. Origin entries in `allowed_clients` continue to authorize metadata paths on that origin; exact entries authorize only that URL. Fetches are limited by `limits.max_oauth_client_metadata_inflight` (default `4`) and `limits.max_oauth_client_metadata_inflight_per_origin` (default `2`).

Durations accept `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`. Refresh grants expire after 30 days without use and after 90 days regardless of use by default; both values are configurable, and the idle lifetime must not exceed the maximum lifetime.

Password verification uses asynchronous PBKDF2 so expensive login checks do not block MCP traffic or health checks. At most `limits.max_password_verifications` checks run globally (default `2`) and `limits.max_password_verifications_per_source` per direct socket address (default `1`); excess checks receive `429` before PBKDF2 starts.

Built-in login failures are limited over a 15-minute window to 10 per direct source, 10 per account, and 100 globally. Lockouts start at 15 minutes and double on repetition up to one hour. Override these values under `auth.builtin_oauth.login_rate_limit`; forwarding headers are ignored and failures never log submitted usernames or passwords.
Built-in authorization codes are isolated per gateway configuration and capped by `limits.max_authorization_codes` (default `1000`). Expired codes are reaped before allocation and during state maintenance; capacity rejects new authorization with `429` without disturbing live codes.
In static mode, refresh-token hashes and grant metadata are capped by
`limits.max_refresh_token_records` (default `10000`). Expired grants are reaped
during token operations and state maintenance. Set `refresh_token_store_file`
to a stable writable path to preserve refresh grants, rotations, and replay
detection across restarts. The versioned state file contains hashes and grant
metadata, never raw tokens, and is replaced atomically with mode `0600`.

If `refresh_token_store_file` is omitted, refresh state remains in memory and the server emits `oauth.refresh_state_ephemeral` at startup. Access tokens signed by a stable key remain valid across restarts, but clients must reauthorize when they next need to refresh.

## Logging
`logging.level` defaults to `info`. Set it to `debug` while setting up the MCP server to emit sanitized structural diagnostics and response-tokenization counts.

Debug logs are sanitized before writing. They do not include raw credentials, opaque reference values, Authorization headers, cookies, request bodies, or response bodies.

```yaml
logging:
  level: debug
```

## Audit
Recent audit events are kept in a per-configuration memory ring and can also be written as append-only JSONL:

```yaml
audit:
  memory_events: 1000
  file: /var/lib/secretsauce/audit/audit.jsonl
```

`audit.memory_events` defaults to 1000 and bounds only the in-memory view; file-backed JSONL retains every successfully written event. The application creates the configured directory once, opens one append-only descriptor at startup, creates a new audit file with mode `0600`, and closes the descriptor with the server. An open or write failure leaves privileged requests fail-open but makes `/health` return `503` with `checks.audit: degraded`. Degradation is sticky until restart; monitor readiness and disk capacity. Because the descriptor remains open, `copytruncate`-style external rotation is compatible, while rename-based rotation requires a restart to reopen the configured path. Mount the audit directory on persistent writable storage in Docker. Audit events are sanitized and do not include raw credentials, opaque reference values, Authorization headers, cookies, request bodies, or downstream response bodies. Opaque downstream access references are still in-memory only and expire on restart.

Expired configured-access and response-secret reference records are removed before issuance and by the periodic state maintenance loop; all reference hashes, indexes, and in-memory values are removed together.
`limits.max_token_records` defaults to 10000 and `limits.max_token_records_per_subject` to 1000. Both configured-access and response-secret capabilities count toward these limits. Live references are never silently evicted; issuance fails atomically with `capacity_exceeded`.

## Services
Each service defines LLM-facing metadata, destinations, credentials, access users, TLS behavior, and policy. `description` should briefly explain what the service is for. `api_docs_url` may point to human or machine-readable API documentation, such as an OpenAPI JSON file; the gateway exposes the URL but does not fetch or proxy it.

Destination host matchers may be exact names, DNS suffixes, or regular expressions. A suffix is matched on DNS-label boundaries and includes its apex: `suffix: example.org` and `suffix: .example.org` both allow `example.org` and `api.example.org`, but never `attackerexample.org`. Suffixes are IDN-canonicalized and cannot be IP literals; use an exact matcher for an IP address.

```yaml
services:
  example-api:
    type: http
    name: Example API
    description: Inventory and deployment metadata API
    api_docs_url: https://api.example.org/openapi.json
```

Credential sources support:

```yaml
source:
  kind: env
  name: SERVICE_API_KEY
```

```yaml
source:
  kind: file
  path: /run/secrets/service_api_key
```

Keep the source value limited to the credential itself. Static request syntax belongs in optional usage affixes so response protection can still recognize the clean credential:

```yaml
credentials:
  - id: api_token
    usage:
      kind: header
      name: X-API-Key
      prefix: "Bearer "
      enforce: true
    source:
      kind: env
      name: SERVICE_API_TOKEN
```

This configuration produces the hint `Set the X-API-Key header value to "Bearer <reference>".` The client sends that complete value, and the gateway replaces only the reference with the clean source value. `suffix` works the same way after the reference. Because opaque references use letters, digits, `_`, and `-`, a non-empty suffix must begin with another delimiter such as `:` or `.` so its boundary is unambiguous. Header affixes cannot contain CR, LF, or NUL and must contain only non-secret static syntax.

`usage.enforce` is an optional named-header security feature and defaults to `false` for compatibility. When false, affixes affect only the usage hint and references retain flexible substring substitution in headers, query values, and bodies. When true, the configured header is gateway-owned: exact placement is accepted, safely repairable wrong affixes or duplicate case variants are clobbered with a sanitized warning, and missing, ambiguous, or wrongly placed references are rejected before downstream I/O. Enforcement never auto-selects a credential. It is currently supported only for `usage.kind: header` with `name` configured.

At debug log level, a source value containing whitespace produces a value-free startup diagnostic suggesting usage affixes. Existing combined values remain valid and are not parsed automatically; for example, a source containing `Bearer XYZ` is still treated as that complete secret, so a response containing only `XYZ` cannot be matched exactly.

Services whose downstream API intentionally requires no authentication must opt in explicitly with `no_auth: true` and omit `credentials`:

```yaml
services:
  camera-api:
    type: http
    name: Camera API
    no_auth: true
    destinations:
      - name: primary
        base_url: http://camera.example.org
    access:
      users:
        - operator@example.org
    policy:
      mode: deny
      rules:
        - id: allow-status
          effect: allow
          priority: 100
          methods: [GET]
          paths: ["/api/status"]
```

Omitting credentials without `no_auth: true` fails startup, as does combining the flag with credentials. SecretSauce still exposes `gateway_access` for this service: clients obtain a normal `gref_` and pass it as `service_request.service_reference`. The gateway validates and consumes that field without forwarding it downstream. `no_auth` disables only downstream credential substitution; gateway authentication, user access controls, destination validation, request policy, TLS settings, auditing, and response protection remain enforced.

`policy.mode` defaults to `deny`. Rules use regex path patterns in MVP.

Endpoint rules may selectively disable response scanning:

```yaml
policy:
  rules:
    - id: allow-status
      effect: allow
      priority: 100
      methods: [GET]
      paths: ["/api/status"]
      secretlint:
        disabled_rules:
          - "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-github"
```

Use `secretlint: { enabled: false }` to disable all Secretlint rules for a matched endpoint. These settings never disable sensitive-name protection, exact configured-credential protection, forged opaque-prefix protection, cookie handling, Base64 validation, or framing normalization.

Binary safeguards can be changed for a matched endpoint independently:

```yaml
policy:
  rules:
    - id: allow-download
      effect: allow
      priority: 100
      methods: [GET]
      paths: ["/api/download"]
      binary_response:
        scan: true
        max_size: 100kb
```

Both fields are optional and default to `scan: true` and `max_size: 100kb`. A positive size uses the same `b`, `kb`, and `mb` syntax as other size limits; `max_size: unlimited` removes only this binary-specific guard.

| `scan` | `max_size` | Binary-body behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `true` | a size | Reject above the size; scan at or below it. |
| `false` | a size | Reject above the size; otherwise pass the body unscanned. |
| `true` | `unlimited` | Scan regardless of binary size. |
| `false` | `unlimited` | Pass binary bodies without body scanning or the binary-specific size guard. |

`scan: false` explicitly accepts the risk that secrets may be exfiltrated in binary response bodies. Every bypass is logged and audited without response content. Response headers and likely-text bodies remain scanned for every setting, and `limits.max_response_body` always remains enforced. Effective settings are visible through `describe_service_policy`; `max_size_bytes: null` means unlimited.

## Secretlint Rules

`SECRETLINT_CONFIG_PATH` defaults to `/config/secretlint.yaml`. The file uses:

```yaml
version: 1
mode: extend
limits:
  max_unique_secrets: 100
  timeout: 5s
rules:
  - id: "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-github"
  - id: "@secretlint/secretlint-rule-pattern"
    options:
      patterns:
        - name: custom-key
          patterns: ["/(?<key>custom_[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/g"]
```

`extend` overlays entries on the bundled strict catalog; `replace` uses only the listed rules. Unknown packages, duplicate IDs, invalid patterns, and invalid limits stop startup.

Scanner capacity defaults to `min(4, availableParallelism)` workers, a 32-job global queue, and one active plus four queued scans per subject. Override these with `SECRETLINT_WORKERS`, `SECRETLINT_QUEUE_MAX`, `SECRETLINT_SUBJECT_ACTIVE_MAX`, `SECRETLINT_SUBJECT_QUEUE_MAX`, and `SECRETLINT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MS`.

Secretlint's own dependency diagnostics are disabled by default, even when the gateway process uses a broad `DEBUG` value such as `DEBUG=*`. Set `SECRETLINT_DEBUG=true` to enable only the Secretlint debug namespaces temporarily. This output is verbose and is separate from the gateway's structured `logging.level` setting; unset the variable or set it to `false` during normal operation.

## Sensitive Name Rules

`SENSITIVE_NAMES_CONFIG_PATH` defaults to `/config/sensitive-names.yaml`. Name detection is separate from Secretlint and uses this strict schema:

```yaml
version: 1
mode: extend
allow_patterns: []
patterns:
  - id: passwords
    regex: "(?:^|_)(?:password|passwd|passphrase)(?:_|$)"
```

All patterns are compiled case-insensitively. Candidate names first gain camel-case boundaries and have non-alphanumeric separators converted to `_`. `extend` starts with the bundled catalog, replaces a bundled pattern with the same ID, and appends new IDs and allow patterns. `replace` uses only the supplied patterns and allows, including an empty catalog. If any allow pattern matches a name, it suppresses all sensitive-name findings for that name. Duplicate IDs, unknown fields, invalid or empty regexes, and values outside the catalog bounds stop startup.

The bundled catalog conservatively covers passwords, secrets, credentials, authorization, qualified API authentication, qualified private/signing/API/access keys, qualified access/refresh/session/ID tokens, connection strings, database URLs, and DSNs. For example, `SERVICE_API_AUTH` is sensitive, while bare or descriptive fields such as `auth`, `auth_mode`, `auth_type`, and `api_authority` remain visible. Bare `key`, `token`, `signing`, `hash`, `_B64`, `_BASE64`, and `_PEM` are not sensitive on their own. For example, `public_key`, `key_id`, `signing_algorithm`, and `token_type` remain visible unless an operator adds a pattern.

For JSON and JSON-like response source text, matching applies to complete, non-empty double-quoted values in direct properties, objects with one string `name` or `key` property and one string `value` property, and complete `NAME=value` JSON strings. The scanner tolerates comments, duplicate keys, trailing or missing commas, and truncated outer containers. It replaces only the original value-content ranges; order, whitespace, duplicate keys, comments, and all bytes outside those ranges are retained. Numbers, booleans, objects, empty strings, single-quoted strings, and unquoted keys are not selected by sensitive names. A recognized sensitive string without a safe closing range fails closed with `secret_scan_failed`.

Independently of Secretlint and sensitive-name matching, response headers and bodies protect HTTP Basic credentials whose case-insensitive `Basic ` scheme is followed by canonical Base64 that decodes to a non-empty `username:password`. The complete scheme and encoded credential are replaced under the `gateway:http-basic-credential` rule ID. Malformed or noncanonical Base64, decoded values without a colon, and empty usernames or passwords are not selected by this detector.

## Proxied HTTP Constraints

Downstream bodies are retained as bytes. UTF-8 text receives full response scanning even when labeled `application/octet-stream`; replacements are applied to byte ranges so all surrounding bytes remain unchanged. Content that has a binary signature, invalid UTF-8, NUL bytes, or a significant control-byte ratio is treated as binary. Binary bodies are limited to 100 KiB by default and receive exact configured-credential, HTTP Basic, and forged opaque-prefix checks. A finding rejects the response rather than corrupting the file.

Clean binary responses are returned as MCP embedded blobs with their original media type. The MCP protocol uses lossless Base64 framing for blobs; `body_size_bytes` and `body_sha256` describe the protected bytes, while `body_encoding` is `mcp_blob` and structured `body` is `null`. Text responses use `body_encoding: utf8` and retain their string body.

- `limits.max_inbound_body` defaults to `1mb` and is enforced while reading authenticated MCP POST bodies and both built-in OAuth form endpoints, including chunked requests and inaccurate `Content-Length` values. Oversize requests receive `413` before JSON or form parsing and cannot consume an authorization code.
- `limits.inbound_body_timeout` defaults to `10s`. Incomplete MCP or OAuth bodies receive `408`, and their connections are closed without parsing partial input.
- Built-in OAuth permits at most `limits.max_unauthenticated_inflight` body readers globally (default `32`) and `limits.max_unauthenticated_inflight_per_source` per direct socket address (default `4`). Excess work receives `429`; forwarding headers never select the limiter identity.
- Authenticated downstream work is limited by `limits.max_service_requests_inflight` globally (default `32`), `limits.max_service_requests_inflight_per_subject` per authenticated subject (default `4`), and `limits.max_service_requests_inflight_per_service` per configured service (default `8`). Excess work returns a structured `capacity_exceeded` tool error before reference redemption, credential substitution, or downstream I/O. Slots are released after every success or failure, and one slow service cannot consume another service's configured capacity.
- Denial explanations are kept in a per-configuration TTL/LRU store. `limits.max_denial_records` defaults to `1000`, `limits.denial_ttl` to `15m`, and `limits.state_sweep_interval` to `1m`.
- MCP HTTP is stateless. Each POST creates a short-lived server transport, authenticates the bearer token independently, returns a JSON response, and releases the transport. The gateway does not issue or require `Mcp-Session-Id`; GET and DELETE on the MCP path return `405`. Gateway service references remain usable across independent requests because they are bound to the authenticated subject and service rather than transport state.

  Deployments upgrading from the former stateful transport must remove `limits.max_mcp_transports`, `limits.max_mcp_transports_per_subject`, `limits.max_mcp_initializations_per_subject`, `limits.mcp_initialization_window`, `limits.max_mcp_initialization_records`, and `limits.mcp_transport_idle_ttl`. These fields now produce a startup error with migration guidance. Reference capacity remains controlled by `limits.max_token_records` and `limits.max_token_records_per_subject`; exhaustion is returned as a structured `capacity_exceeded` tool error, not an MCP transport `429`.
- Caller-supplied HTTP authority, forwarding, and hop-by-hop headers are rejected before credential substitution. This includes `Host`, `:authority`, `Forwarded`, every `X-Forwarded-*` header, `Connection`, `Keep-Alive`, proxy authorization headers, `TE`, `Trailer`, `Transfer-Encoding`, and `Upgrade`. The outbound `Host` header is derived from the validated destination URL.
- Named credential headers can opt into gateway ownership with `usage.enforce: true`. Exact reference templates are accepted; safely repairable overrides are clobbered and warned, while missing, ambiguous, or wrongly placed references fail before downstream I/O. Enforcement is off by default.
- Destination paths are canonicalized once before policy evaluation and downstream transmission. Duplicate separators and trailing separators are removed. Percent escapes for ASCII unreserved characters, separators, backslashes, NUL, and percent itself are rejected because downstream routers may decode them differently; encoded UTF-8 data and spaces remain supported. Query parameters are not part of path-policy matching.
- `Cookie`, `Cookie2`, `Set-Cookie`, and `Set-Cookie2` are prohibited. Request occurrences are rejected; response occurrences are removed with sanitized warnings.
- Caller-supplied `Content-Length` is discarded and recomputed after request substitution and response transformation.
- `limits.max_request_body` is enforced on the final outbound bytes after reference substitution and declared Base64 decoding. A body at the limit is accepted with a recomputed `Content-Length`; a body over the limit returns `request_too_large` before downstream I/O.
- `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64` declares a whole Base64 response or string request body. Declared bodies are decoded before sensitive-name scanning or opaque-token substitution and canonically re-encoded afterward; field-level Base64/PEM values are not decoded. Undeclared Base64-looking content remains opaque. Other or conflicting transfer encodings fail closed.
- `limits.max_response_body` is enforced during the downstream network read. Declared or streamed oversize responses are aborted and return `response_too_large`; partial bodies are never scanned or returned.
- Decoded Base64 request bodies must be valid UTF-8. Response bodies are classified from their decoded bytes: likely text is UTF-8 scanned, while likely binary follows the binary safeguards and blob-delivery rules above.
