# Security Notes

- The gateway is not a secrets vault. It is a service-scoped HTTP gateway that keeps configured credentials out of MCP tool results.
- Policy is enforced before credential substitution.
- Destination scheme, host, and port are validated before credential substitution.
- Caller-controlled authority, forwarding, and hop-by-hop headers are rejected before credential substitution, and the outbound HTTP authority is derived from the validated destination URL.
- Configured-credential `tok_…` values are bound to subject, service, destination, and credential. Response-derived `sec_…` values are bound to subject and service so they can be reused across that service's destinations. MCP transport session IDs are not a hard token boundary.
- `tls.verify: false` is supported for self-signed homelab services and is reported in response metadata and audit events.
- Secretlint scans response header values and UTF-8 body source text. JSON is never parsed or reserialized, so all bytes outside replacement ranges remain unchanged.
- Exact configured credentials are always tokenized, even when endpoint Secretlint rules are disabled.
- `tok_` and `sec_` are reserved prefixes. A candidate is exempted only when it is live and belongs to the current subject/service; forged, expired, or wrong-scope candidates are wrapped in a new `sec_…` and audited without their values.
- A whole response body is Base64-decoded only when declared by `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64`; decoded data must be UTF-8 and is re-encoded canonically after scanning.
- Cookie headers are rejected on proxied requests and removed from proxied responses. Cookie-dependent downstream APIs are unsupported.
- Request and returned response `Content-Length` values are computed from final transmitted/returned bytes after substitution or tokenization. Caller-supplied transfer encoding is rejected.
- Scanning uses a bounded worker pool and fails closed on overload, timeout, malformed input, or scanner failure.
- Avoid allowing endpoints that return backups, complete config dumps, token lists, private keys, or other bulk secret material.
- Audit events do not include raw credentials, opaque token values, Authorization headers, cookies, request bodies, or response bodies.
- Debug logging is opt-in through `logging.level: debug` and records only sanitized structural details and tokenization counts.
