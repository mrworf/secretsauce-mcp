# Codex And ChatGPT Desktop Setup

## OAuth Mode
Add the MCP server to Codex config:

```toml
[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway]
url = "https://gateway.example.org/mcp"
enabled = true
auth = "oauth"
default_tools_approval_mode = "prompt"
tool_timeout_sec = 60

[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway.tools.list_services]
approval_mode = "auto"

[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway.tools.describe_service_policy]
approval_mode = "auto"

[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway.tools.explain_denial]
approval_mode = "auto"

[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway.tools.request_tokens]
approval_mode = "prompt"

[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway.tools.service_request]
approval_mode = "prompt"
```

Then run:

```bash
codex mcp login agent_credential_gateway
```

Register the Codex OAuth callback URL and port with the chosen identity provider according to that provider's instructions.

## Bearer Development Mode

```toml
[mcp_servers.agent_credential_gateway]
url = "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "AGENT_GATEWAY_MCP_TOKEN"
enabled = true
default_tools_approval_mode = "prompt"
```

## ChatGPT Desktop
ChatGPT desktop uses the shared Codex MCP host configuration. Configure the server for Codex, then restart or refresh ChatGPT desktop so it can see the MCP server.

## ChatGPT Web
ChatGPT web developer-mode apps connect to the hosted MCP endpoint. The ChatGPT app Server URL must be the full MCP endpoint URL, including the configured `server.mcp_path`:

```text
https://mcp.example.org/mcp
```

Do not enter only the public origin as the app Server URL. `server.resource` and `auth.builtin_oauth.issuer` use the origin, such as `https://mcp.example.org`; the ChatGPT Server URL uses that origin plus `/mcp`.

Use `auth.mode: builtin_oauth` or an external OAuth provider for hosted ChatGPT. Bearer mode publishes protected resource metadata with `authorization_servers: []`, so ChatGPT cannot start an OAuth login flow and may report "No OAuth" during setup.

For the built-in private OAuth mode:

1. Set `server.resource` and `auth.builtin_oauth.issuer` to the public HTTPS origin, for example `https://mcp.example.org`.
2. Configure one admin username and a PBKDF2 password hash through environment variables or mounted secret files.
3. Mount a stable RSA private signing key at `auth.builtin_oauth.signing_key_file`.
4. Add ChatGPT's CIMD origin or exact client metadata URL to `auth.builtin_oauth.allowed_clients`.
5. In ChatGPT developer mode, create the app with the public `/mcp` URL.

The signing key must survive container restarts. If it is generated inside the container or stored on ephemeral media, ChatGPT's existing OAuth access token cannot be verified after restart and the app may require reconnecting.

The built-in server issues rotating refresh tokens so ChatGPT and Codex can renew expired access tokens without another login. Refresh grants are held in memory and are lost when the gateway restarts; clients then start a new authorization-code flow.

Use these values in the ChatGPT developer-mode app form:

1. Set Connection to Server URL.
2. Set Server URL to `https://mcp.example.org/mcp`.
3. Set Authentication to OAuth.
4. Open Advanced OAuth settings, allow the discovered OAuth settings, and select the required scopes, usually `gateway.read`, `gateway.tokens`, and `gateway.request`.
5. Complete the OAuth login.
6. Confirm the app shows actions after OAuth completes: `list_services`, `describe_service_policy`, `request_tokens`, `service_request`, and `explain_denial`.

If ChatGPT says the app is connected but shows "No app actions available yet", OAuth probably completed but ChatGPT did not reach MCP `initialize` or `tools/list`. Check that the app Server URL ends with `/mcp`, and that the reverse proxy forwards `/mcp` to the gateway unchanged.
